TempDir - Module to check the correct temporary directory in every OS supported by PERL

What's the problem?
Every PERL tool use temporary files.
If you want your code can be simply portable on different OS, you need to select
the correct temporary directory.
The purpose of this module is to check the correct temporary directory in every
OS supported by PERL to use it.
We need your help.
We ask you to send us the correct tempory directory for every OS supported by
PERL and to suggest us good modifies (<sanface@sanface.com>).

At the moment this is the list of OS supported and the list of variables and
directories the module check to find the correct to use:
Windows 32 bit ('95, '98, NT)
$ENV{TEMP}, $ENV{TMP}, $ENV{windir} . '\\temp', 'c:\\temp', '.'

Unix
  [aix bsd386 dec_osf dgux freebsd hp_osf1 hpux irix linux mips_osf1 netbsd next
   sco sco_xenix solaris sunos svr4 sysv ultrix uts]
$ENV{TMPDIR}, '/var/tmp', '/usr/tmp', '/tmp', '.'

Mac                           $ENV{TMPDIR}
The default Mac OS directory can be found with the FindFolder toolbox function
use Mac::Files;
$tmp = FindFolder(kOnSystemDisk,kTemporaryFolderType);
However, MacPerl automatically assigns this directory to $ENV{TMPDIR}.

OpenVMS                       /sys\$scratch (or SYS\$SCRATCH)

beos                          /tmp
# BeOS    [from David Cantrell mailto:david@wirestation.co.uk]
# /tmp, which is a symlink to /boot/var/tmp.
# It's probably a good idea to use /tmp though in case it changes in the future.
# Does it support $ENV{'TEMP'} ?
# Not sure

If the module can't recognize your OS the temporary directory is set to .

Use testtmpdir.pl to test the module on your OS and testOS.pl to know the value
of $^O PERL variable on your OS.

Availability

The latest version of this library is likely to be available from:
http://www.sanface.com
and at any CPAN mirror ( http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/S/SA/SANFACE/ )

A lot of users notify me that:
the File::Spec module included in perl 5.6 (almost in beta) will include
a tmpdir function/method.  This code works now with perl 5.005_61.
  use File::Spec::Functions 'tmpdir';
  my $tmpdir = tmpdir();

Does this module require perl 5.6?
Can I install it with other perl version?
Where can I find it?

If it supports all PERL 5.xxx version we'll stop the develop of TempDir module.
